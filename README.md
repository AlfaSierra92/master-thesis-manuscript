# On the performance of Decentralized Congestion Control in a real IEEE 802.11p testbed
Master degree thesis in Automotive Connectivity course @ Unimore 2023/24.

## Abstract
Over the past two decades, road safety has benefited from significant technological advances, particularly through the development of Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) and Vehicular Ad-hoc Networks (VANETs). This thesis explores the importance of such systems in improving vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication, highlighting the crucial role of standardizing Cooperative Awareness Messages (CAMs) and Decentralized Environmental Notification Messages (DENMs). The implementation of technologies such as Dedicated Short-Range Communication (DSRC) has facilitated the exchange of essential information for Collision Avoidance (CA) applications, helping to reduce traffic accidents.

The main focus of this study is the analysis of Quality of Service (QoS) policies in Linux environments for devices supporting the IEEE 802.11p standard, a key aspect of Decentralized Congestion Control (DCC). Through a testbed composed of Rock devices, the performance of IEEE 802.11p and DCC protocols will be examined, considering various performance parameters. Congestion management proves to be crucial in ensuring the effectiveness of security and infotainment applications in VANETs. Using tools such as iPerf, network throughput and performance variability will be evaluated, providing essential data to optimize the user experience in critical scenarios. This work is intended to contribute to research in the field of smart mobility, promoting innovative solutions for safer and more efficient driving.
