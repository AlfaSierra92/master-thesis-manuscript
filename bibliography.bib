  abstract = {The automotive industry is scrambling to equip high- and middle-segment vehicles with communication capabilities that will enable the commercialization of connected vehicles in the near future. Although both IEEE and 3GPP are developing new solutions, it is likely that IEEE 802.11p will be the protocol of choice. In this paper, we develop an open-source testing framework for IEEE 802.11p cards and characterize the performance of Unex DHXA-222 cards in terms of throughput and packet loss, especially when different traffic classes, hence access categories, are selected.},
